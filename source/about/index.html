<p>Gerry AI is a collection of projects created as a reusable framework of libraries for building and using
automated planning algorithms.</p>

<p>The objective of this project is to lower the barrier to entry for people wanting to write or use automated
planning algorithms; see our first blog post.</p>

<p>Gerry AI aims to achieve this in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fully open source with clear licensing</li>
    <li>Code hosted on GitHub for ease of access and collaboration</li>
    <li>Properly packaged for use in Maven projects</li>
    <li>Coded to be clear to understand, reusable, extensible and fully tested</li>
</ul>
